# RPS Game in Python

RPS: Rock, Paper and Scissors is a game in which two or more players stretch their hands at the same time, in which each has formed a symbol.
- A closed hand means stone.
- The open hand means paper.
- The hand with the index and middle fingers extended means scissors.

Then, players compare their hand symbols with those of other participants to decide if there is a winner/loser or a draw as follows:
- Rock wins from Scissors.
- Paper beats Rock.
- Scissors beats Paper.
- In case the symbols are the same, there is a draw.
## Objective
Create a Python console application that simulates an RPS game where the user plays against the computer and the result is displayed.

## How to install and run

#### 1 - Testing
First of all, ensure you already have a Python interpreter installed locally.

To test this, just open a terminal/cmd(windows) and type:
```
python3 -v
```
If something appears, it's ok to go.<br>
If doesn't, try to install it properly and come back here.

#### 2 - Downloading
The next step is to download this game: this can be made via
- cloning this directory,
- or directly downloading

**Cloning**
If you choose to clone this project, follow these steps:<br>
Open a terminal/cmd again, type this and hit enter:
```
git clone git@github.com:Thiago-Gonzalez/RPS_Game.git
```
When finished:
```
cd RPS_Game
```
Now you are on the folder/directory of the game, jump to Running section.

**Direct download**
This path is somewhat easier, just:
- click on "Code" button
- click on "Download ZIP"
- save locally
- open its folder/directory
- right click and search "Open with cmd" or "Open in a terminal"

#### 3 - Running
When in the game's folder, just type in the cmd/terminal:
