## RPS Game in Python

RPS: Rock, Paper and Scissors is a game in which two or more players stretch their hands at the same time, in which each has formed a symbol.
- A closed hand means stone.
- The open hand means paper.
- The hand with the index and middle fingers extended means scissors.

Then, players compare their hand symbols with those of other participants to decide if there is a winner/loser or a draw as follows:
- Rock wins from Scissors.
- Paper beats Rock.
- Scissors beats Paper.
- In case the symbols are the same, there is a draw.
# Objective
